# Solidity + Foundry Implementation of Curve

## Curve finance is one of the largest liquidity providers in DeFi, most notably for stablecoins.

## Curve is an exchange liquidity pool on Ethereum.

The Curve DAO token powers the Curve.fi financial platform, which acts as an exchange and automated market maker. AMMs enable a different model of trading where assets can be exchanged permissionlessly and in an automated manner.

Curve is DeFi’s leading AMM (Automated market maker). Many liquidity pools have been launched through Curve’s factory and incentivized by Curve’s DAO.

Curve can be broadly divided into various categories:

- StableSwap: Exchange contracts and core functionality of the protocol.
- DAO: Protocol governance and value accrual.
- Factory: Permissionless deployment of Curve metapools.
- Registry: Standardized API and on-chain resources to aid 3rd-party integrations.

Users rely on Curve’s proprietary formulas to provide: high liquidity, low slippage, and low fee transactions among ERC-20 tokens.
Curve is different from exchanges that match buyers and sellers - this is where liquidity pools come into play. For a successful volume of exchange, Curve needs a high volume of liquidity (tokens) and therefore offers various rewards to liquidity providers.

Curve is non-custodial, meaning that Curve developers do not have access to your tokens. Curve pools are also non upgradable, so you can rest assured knowing that the logic protecting your funds can never change.

Reminder: with a custodial wallet, a third party manages the private keys, while with non-custodial, the user manages them and you essentially have full control over your own private keys.

Liquidity pools are pools of tokens that sit in smart contracts and can be exchanged or withdrawn at rates set by the parameters of the smart contract.

Adding liquidity to a pool gives you the chance to earn trading fees and rewards.

Removes the need for centralized market makers.

### CRV is a governance and utility token for Curve.

Curve has grown quickly by tapping into the underdeveloped stablecoin market where users need to move from one to another.
Centralized exchanges typically have higher fees.

So Curve.fi became the best place to exchange stablecoins because of low slippage and low fees.

Crypto pools are Curve pools holding assets with different prices. They use liquidity more effectively by concentrating it at current prices. As trades occur, the pool readjusts its internal price to the highest liquidity region w/o causing losses for the pool.

Becoming a liquidity provider in a Curve crypto pools is very similar to stable pools: You gain exposure and risks to all assets in the pools.
Fees on these pools range from 0.04% to 0.4%. The current free varies based on how close the price is from the internal oracle.
The main purpose of the Curve DAO token is to incentivize liquidity providers and get more users involved in the governance of the protocol.
CRV has 3 main uses: voting, staking, and boosting.

Governance tokens are a type of cryptocurrency that allow token holders to vote on the direction of a blockchain project.

## CONVEX

### Convex Finance is a platform built on top of Curve Finance/Curve protocol and aims to enhance the yield generation potential for users/LPs who provide liquidity to Curve's stablecoin pools.

Convex Finance focuses on optimizing the rewards that liquidity providers receive from participating in Curve's liquidity pools
Convex allows Cruve.fi liquidity providers to earn trading fees and claim boosted CRV without locking CRV themselves. LPs can receive boosted CRV and liquidity mining rewards with little effort.

This all allows for a better balance between liquidity providers and CRV stakers, as well as better capital efficiency.
Basically, Convex acts like a yield aggregator for Curve Finance’s liquidity pools. It aims to make it more lucrative for users to provide liquidity to Curve’s stablecoin pools by actively managing and compounding their rewards.

Yield aggregators are protocols or platforms that allow users to stake their LP (liquidity provider) tokens in vaults.
These are automated processes designed to produce the highest yields (interest) for LPs.
